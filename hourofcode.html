    <p class="story-text">In December, Green County students held an hour of code event sponsored by <a href="https://www.code.org/">Code.org</a> Students assembled in the gymnasium to learn more about computer science and programming. Kentucky Senator David Givens, who is a prominent advocate for computer science and supports many bills that fund CTE Education programs, spoke at the event, discussing his experience with programming.</p>

    <p class="story-text"> "When you think about growing up as I did with Legos and Lincoln Logs and building blocks, thats the basic pieces of creativity," Stated Sen. Givens, "The computer provides us the oppurtinity today to do it in really inivatives ways." </p>

    <p class="story-text">Days after the assembly, during Computer Science Education Week, the TSA Club (Technology Student Association) visited Green County Intermediate School to teach block-based coding, a programming language that utilizes drag-and-drop blocks instead of text. Intermediate school STEAM Teacher Chelsea Gilbert assisted with the event.</p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="wrapper">
    <p class="story-text">“I believe there are so many components and problem-solving skills that computer science offers that will help them in other areas of their lives as well, that I think it's crucial they get this experience, and if it is a career they want to pursue, they can get a love for it early on,” stated Ms. Gilbert</p>
